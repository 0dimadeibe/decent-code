# UI text

*These items apply to **all text regardless of who wrote it**; text provided by UX or business stakeholders should be reviewed and any issues resolved with the author.*

----

Be **accurate and unambiguous**.

**Avoid contradicting** other text or actual application behaviour. Existing text in other areas of the application may need to be updated.

Use **correct spelling and grammar**.

Use **consistent capitalisation** of terms.

Use **consistent style and tone**.

Use **correct tense (current/past).** This also applies to log messages.

Use **consistent terminology** when referring for example to application features and business concepts.

**Avoid relying on enum member order for UI display order.** Logical or alphabetical display order is often different from order of members in code. The order of members is also liable to change, without expectation of any side-effects.

Use **realistic and professional mock data**. Realistic data helps detect issues that could occur later using real data. Unprofessional or joke data can cause offence, or give a poor impression of the team - you never know who's going to see it and what frame of mind they're going to be in.
