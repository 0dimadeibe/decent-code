# CSS


## General

**CSS is code, too.** The items from the other topics in this guide apply. It requires code review, and is subject to automated and manual quality checks and rules - just like any other application code. Poor CSS is difficult to modify and extend, and can make it difficult to change or refactor the application.

**Keep CSS close to the component code that it styles.** Read: [files](files.md).

**Resolve design inconsistencies.** UI designs are sometimes inconsistent in their styling, for example spacings or colours. Avoid carrying these over to the application's style code; not only do inconsistencies detract from the product, but they also tend to drive poor CSS. Some inconsistencies are trivial, while others need discussion with designers.
