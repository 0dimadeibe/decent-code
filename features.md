# Features

**Ambiguities and questions have been resolved.** Document them with the requirement on the issue tracker.

The requirement **does not contradict or logically conflict with existing features.** Strive for a coherent user experience.

The implementation **meets the requirement**, taking clarifications and refinements into account. Read the requirement once again to make sure nothing was missed.

The implementation **doesn't introduce new unwanted behaviour.**

The implementation **meets the non-functional requirements**. If they aren't defined, make an effort to find out and help define adequate ones. Examples include response times, supported browsers and versions, and targeted devices/form factors.

The implementation **meets general application requirements and conventions** not explicitly mentioned on this piece of work or perhaps anywhere. Be familiar with existing functionality, and strive for consistency.

The implementation **does not add friction to the developer experience/workflow** that hampers productivity. There should be a straightforward way of disabling or a set-and-forget workaround for anything that does.

**Think ahead to future work.** We want to keep things simple and avoid building things we'll never need. We can however avoid making life hard for our future selves by being aware of upcoming and medium-term requirements, and bearing them in mind today.
